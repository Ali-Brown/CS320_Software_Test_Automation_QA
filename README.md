# CS320_Software_Test_Automation_QA

## How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
- Implementing effective and inexhaustive tests and using test automation tools where necessary to ensure high security and efficiency.
## How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
- By designing and implementing tests that closely conforms to each user requirement. A use case test may be designed for each requirement.
## How do I approach designing software?
- By designing the software with testing in mind, building effective tests to ensure the code not only do what it is supposed to do, but also know all the possible things it might do by thoroughly testing it. I'll also consider using testing automation and CI tools to increase effectiveness and productivity.
